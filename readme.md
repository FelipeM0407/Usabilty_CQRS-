# PeopleApiCQRS

This project is a simple API built with .NET 8 to demonstrate the basic principles of Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS). The goal is to show how to separate commands (write operations) from queries (read operations) in a way that makes the system more modular, maintainable, and scalable.

## Overview

The **PeopleApiCQRS** project aims to demonstrate how CQRS can be applied in a .NET API. In this project, commands are separated from queries to follow the CQRS pattern, which allows independent handling of write and read operations. This separation can improve scalability and flexibility, particularly in complex applications.
